This is a project done in the last year of high school and it is used to manage the pcto hours of a school, also managing the classes and the privileges of the prof or secretary accounts.
I used XAMPP to create it so if you want to try it just follow the steps below:
1. Download XAMPP and setup it starting setup_xampp.bat
2. Delete all default files from 'htdocs' and put in it the content of the project folder
3. Start XAMPP, start Apache and MySQL
4. Click 'Admin' of this last and on Phpmyadmin create a DB called exacly 'pcto'
5. On import section select 'pcto.sql' and import it
6. If everything went well, cliccking 'Admin' of Apache or searching 'localhost' on the browser you will see the login page

It's up to you to discover all the features (:
